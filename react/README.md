## What is React?

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a JavaScript-centric UI library. It abstracts away the DOM, giving a simpler programming model and better performance. It can also render on the server using Node, and can even power native apps using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). React implements one-way reactive data flow which reduces boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding.

## What is JSX?

[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) is a JavaScript syntax extension that looks similar to XML. We use it with React because it is a concise and familiar syntax for defining tree structures with attributes.

For more info, see [JSX in Depth](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html).
